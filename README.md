Hi, I'm Sarah 👋


🪞 About

I’m a product designer who loves building things that feel smart and human. I’m studying Information Management, specializing in User Experience and Data Science at the University of Washington, where I explore how AI and design can work together to make complex systems simple. I’ve been creating for as long as I can remember, from sketching and building small projects as a kid to designing products that solve real problems today. I’m curious by nature, always experimenting, and driven by the challenge of turning ideas into experiences that make life a little easier.
