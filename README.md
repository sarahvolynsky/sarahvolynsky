Hi, I'm Sarah ðŸ‘‹


ðŸªž About

Iâ€™m a product strategist and creative operator passionate about designing AI systems that make business workflows seamless and human-centered.

7+ years of experience across e-commerce, UX, operations, and brand strategy. My work lives at the intersection of design, data, and intelligent automation, where technology starts to feel human again.

My journey began at 15 when I helped grow Vinyl Status, my brotherâ€™s garage-born sticker business, into a high-volume Printify manufacturing partner. Since then, I've worked across e-commerce, tech, and consumer companies, begun graduate studies to bridge design, data, and research, and co-founded OptalAI.
